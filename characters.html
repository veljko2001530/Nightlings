      When the lights go out, the Nightlings move as quiet as breath. 
      They don’t come to scare you — they guard your dreams and push 
      nightmares into the corner. If you hear a faint crackle or see 
      a candle flicker by itself... that’s their sign.

      <h2>Grimmie</h2>
      <img src="assets/grimmie.png" alt="Grimmie the Nightling">
      <p>Sits quietly by the door, listening to the hallway. When a bad shadow appears, Grimmie growls — and the shadow flees like smoke.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Nyx</h2>
      <img src="assets/nyx.png" alt="Nyx the Nightling">
      <p>The quietest of them all. Nyx erases traces of fear like chalk on a board. If you hear a whisper saying “it’s nothing,” that’s Nyx calming the dark.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Reddox</h2>
      <img src="assets/reddoxx.png" alt="Reddox the Nightling">
      <p>Always smiling, sparking a small flame in the dark. His laughter scatters bad dreams until they vanish like dust.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Brownie</h2>
      <img src="assets/brownie.png" alt="Brownie the Nightling">
      <p>Warm as a blanket, Brownie sits by the pillow and keeps watch. When your eyes grow heavy, he wiggles his nose and dreams turn soft.</p>
