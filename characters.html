    <p>
      When the lights go out, the Nightlings move as quiet as breath.  
      They don’t come to scare you — they guard your dreams and push nightmares into the corner.  
      If you hear a faint crackle or see a candle flicker by itself… that’s their sign.

      <h2>Grimmie</h2>
      <img src="assets/grimmie.png" alt="Grimmie">
      <p>
        Silent watcher by the door.  
        When bad shadows creep, Grimmie growls and they scatter like smoke.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
      <h2>Nyx</h2>
      <img src="assets/nyx.png" alt="Nyx">
      <p>
        The quietest of them all.  
        Nyx erases fear like chalk on a board.  
        If you hear a whisper, “it’s nothing,” that’s Nyx calming the dark.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
      <h2>Reddox</h2>
      <img src="assets/reddoxx.png" alt="Reddox">
      <p>
        Fiery as embers, Reddox sparks small flames in the dark.  
        His glowing grin makes even nightmares crumble into dust.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="character">
      <h2>Brownie</h2>
      <img src="assets/brownie.png" alt="Brownie">
      <p>
        Warm as a blanket, Brownie sits by your pillow.  
        When your eyes grow heavy, he twitches his nose — and dreams turn soft again.
      </p>

    <p>Maybe there are more of them... Can you collect them all?</p>
